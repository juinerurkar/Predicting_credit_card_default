# Predicting_credit_card_default
Credit card data is quite insightful and provides a considerable amount of information about the consumers, which can help in preventing crimes against consumers as well as merchants. However, in addition to the losses suffered by consumers and merchants, banks have to suffer the highest amount of losses due to the credit card frauds and defaulters.  Hence, it is very crucial to develop a method to solve this pressing problem by predicting fraudulent behavior or default in payment using the records from past transactions.
